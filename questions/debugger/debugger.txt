debuggers

ptrace, ltrace

gdb, dbx, ...

why:
    1. find errors, do optimizations
    2. analysis

what can I do:
    1. run a new process or attach to an existing
    2. pause process at different locations:
        a. specific addresses
        b. functions
        c. syscalls
    3. peek, dump and change process memory
    4. peek and change registers
    5. scripting (python for gdb)

how it does NOT work:
    1. no simulation (ex. as valgrind, qemu)
    2. no magic

how it does work (user level):
    1. child runs ptrace (PTRACE_TRACEME), then debugger (parent) can control it (also parent can attach to any process somehow)
    2. ptraced child stops after any signal, then parent can control it (while it's stopped)

start gdb:
    gdb <filepath>
    gdb -p <pid> (echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope)

usage:
    run
    continue
    step, stepi
    next, nexti
    break <func|addr|if ...>
    catch syscall <syscall name or id>
    info registers
    backtrace
    print ($rax, printf, ...)
    x/10xg <addr>
    disas, set, gcore, ...

how does ptrace work (linux, api):
    1. read\write data - copy from\to user
    2. read\write registers - ...
    3. ...

how breakpoints work (let's set bp to addr):
    1. read and save instruction at addr
    2. write trap instruction instead (int3, something invalid)
    3. when CPU sees trap, it'll produce interrupt (that goes to kernel, then to debugee, then to debugger)
    4. if IP in breakpoints, that's it, process is stopped at breakpoint; if not - crash, ...
    5. when continue: write saved instruction back
    6. step
    7. write trap back
    8. continue
P.S. not for multithreading

DWARF - debug info format (for elf kekw), symbols, lines, structs, constants, ...

antidebug:
    1. ask if debugger is present (/proc/<pid>/status TracerPid)
    solution:
        disable that api (kernel module)
    2. detect 0xCC, try SIGTRAP handlers
    3. integrity check
    solution 2-3:
        a. hbreak (hardware breakpoint, at most 4, no code modification)
    4. add own debugger (one process - one debugger) (ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 1, 0) != -1)
    5. ASLR check
