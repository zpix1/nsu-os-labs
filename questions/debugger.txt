debuggers

ptrace, ltrace

gdb, dbx, ...

why:
    1. find errors, do optimizations
    2. analysis

what can I do:
    1. run a new process or attach to an existing
    2. pause process at different locations:
        a. specific addresses
        b. functions
        c. syscalls
    3. peek, dump and change process memory
    4. peek and change registers
    5. scripting (python for gdb)

how it does NOT work:
    1. no simulation (ex. as valgrind, qemu)
    2. no magic

how it does work (user level):
    1. child runs ptrace (PTRACE_TRACEME), then debugger (parent) can control it (also parent can attach to any process somehow)
    2. ptraced child stops after any signal, then parent can control it (while it's stopped)
    3.
